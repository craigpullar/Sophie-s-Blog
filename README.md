# Sophie-s-Blog

<p>Another freelance project I took on. I created a completely functioning blog with a design I was
very proud of. The site will be going live again soon. The CMS was the part I was actually most proud of. It featured my best design to date. This was the project where I came to use JQuery more in my designs.</p>
